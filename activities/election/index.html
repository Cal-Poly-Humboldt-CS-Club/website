          <h3>CS Club Officer Roles - At a Glance</h3>
          <ul class="election-roles">
            <li><strong>üíº President*</strong> - The lead organizer and go-to person for the club. Runs meetings, keeps the team on track, communicates with students and faculty, and makes sure everything's moving forward. Big-picture thinker and good at keeping people in the loop. Also responsible for coordinating major club events like the Hackathon for Social Good (Spring) and the ICPC competition (Fall). üëâ <em>This position must be filled and is open since our current president is graduating!</em></li>
            <li><strong>ü§ù Vice President</strong> - Flexible leadership role to support the President, help run events, take on fun projects, and lead when needed. Perfect for stepping into a leadership role without carrying everything alone.</li>
            <li><strong>üí∞ Treasurer*</strong> - Handles the club's finances. Keeps track of the budget, helps brainstorm and run fundraising ideas/events, and works with campus organizations, local businesses, alumni, and more for reimbursements and funding. üëâ <em>This position must be filled (and cannot be the same person as President) for the club to stay active.</em></li>
            <li><strong>üìù Secretary</strong> - Keeps everyone organized. Takes notes at meetings, sends reminders, updates documents, and helps manage communication and logistics. Sends out the weekly email newsletter to update members on meetings, events, and opportunities.</li>
            <li><strong>üì¢ Social Media Manager</strong> - Creates posts, updates the CS Club Instagram, and helps promote events and opportunities online. Ideal for someone with a creative streak and a good eye for memes, graphics, or catchy captions.</li>
            <li><strong>üìé Outreach & Promotion Coordinator</strong> - Helps with flyer creation, poster runs, and spreading the word about club events around campus and beyond. May also involve helping manage the Discord server or communicating with other clubs and departments.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><em>*Note:</em> In order to remain a recognized and active student organization, the club must have at least one President and one Treasurer, and they must be two different people. Additionally, officers of the 2024-2025 academic year may run again for any role in this year's election!</p>
        
          <h3>FAQ</h3>
          <h4>What is the time commitment like?</h4>
          <p>It's flexible ‚Äî you get to help shape the club! The time commitment depends on:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>How often you hold meetings (weekly, biweekly, monthly)</li>
            <li>The types of events you run (e.g., Coding Caf√©, workshops, guest speakers)</li>
            <li>How well you delegate and collaborate with your officer team</li>
            <li>Whether you organize extra events (like the Hackathon for Social Good or ICPC competition)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>On the low end, expect an average of about 10 hours/week, especially if you're in a lead role. You can adjust based on your availability and team support.</p>
        
          <h4>Do I need to be a Computer Science major?</h4>
          <p>Nope! Officers can be from any major ‚Äî including Software Engineering, Math, Environmental Science, etc. As long as you're interested in tech, coding, or community-building, you're welcome!</p>
        
          <h4>Do I need advanced CS or leadership knowledge?</h4>
          <p>Not at all. You don't need to be an expert or a seasoned leader.</p>
          <p>What matters most is:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>A willingness to learn</li>
            <li>Comfort with leading meetings (or growing into that)</li>
            <li>Resourcefulness ‚Äî for example, inviting guest speakers on topics you're not familiar with</li>
          </ul>
          <p>You're not expected to know everything! The goal is to build community, share learning opportunities, and supplement everyone's education ‚Äî including your own.</p>
        
          <h4>Are there any eligibility requirements?</h4>
          <p>No prior experience is required, but some campus rules apply:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The President and Treasurer must:
              <ul>
                <li>Have at least a 2.0 GPA</li>
                <li>Be enrolled in 6+ units (undergrads) or 3+ units (grads with 3.0+ GPA)</li>
                <li>Be in good standing with the university</li>
                <li>Not be on any kind of academic or disciplinary probation</li>
                <li>Undergrads must have fewer than 150 completed units, grads fewer than 50</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        
          <h4>Who is the club's faculty advisor?</h4>
          <p>Currently, it's Professor Ben Kovitz.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Each leadership team has the ability to change their faculty advisor.</li>
            <li>Officers (especially the President and Treasurer) will work with the advisor regularly for things like fundraising forms.</li>
            <li>The advisor doesn't need to attend meetings, but they should be kept in the loop.</li>
          </ul>
        
          <h4>Can I run for more than one position?</h4>
          <p>Yes! You can absolutely express interest in multiple roles. If you're elected to more than one, we'll ask for your preferred position, and the runner-up will be offered the other.</p>
        
          <h4>What support will I get if I'm elected?</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>A comprehensive transition guide and officer onboarding</li>
            <li>Help from past officers (like me üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è - Lily)</li>
            <li>Access to templates, docs, and communication tools</li>
            <li>A team! You'll never be doing this alone :)</li>
          </ul>
